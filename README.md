# hello-world
my first step to be a github coder
As a student majoring in software engineering, I am very embarrassed. I have been tossing and turning to the opposite side for a few years. I finally chose the path of college major. I knew that I had to think about it right now. I have been working with my peers for a long time. But things are man-made. I just want to think clearly before I can act.
